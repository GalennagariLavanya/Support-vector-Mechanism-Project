# Support-vector-Mechanism-Project
Project title: Using the support vector mechanism algorithm of super vised machine learning, predict iris.csv data set to find out spices will be same or different.

# Task:

1.Preprocess the data skit learn library

2.Load the data using sklearn model selection default arguement 

3.on the basis of your dataset train test and split svm model 

4.implement support vector mechanism classifier using svm_classifier.thr svm must be "Linear" 

5.train the classifier on the training data

6.find out the prediction value on the test data 

7.test the model with the help of accuracy,accuracy should be lie in the range of 0 to 1.

# Conclusion:
According to my support vector mechanism model the species are linear with the accuracy of 1.00.
hence proved model was sucessfully implement
